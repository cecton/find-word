find-word
=========

I made this code because my brother keeps asking help for a game where you have
to guess a word and they provide you: 4 pictures, the number of characters in
the word and the allowed letters.

Example
-------

The pictures depict:
 *  a day of the week
 *  the number 52
 *  the numbers 1 to 7
 *  a calendar

The allowed letters are: A, H, N, B, Q, I, R, E, S, E, C, M

The solution is (in French): semaine (week)

But Why?
--------

Right now Rust feels like the easiest language I have in mind to do about
anything. Even simple things like this. It's a very small algorithm with
mutability and it was easy to achieve and test properly with Rust.

Isn't that cheating?
--------------------

I'm sorry I thought the whole point of that game was to make the algorithm. ðŸ˜‡
